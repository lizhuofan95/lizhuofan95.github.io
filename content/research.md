<!-- When I started high school, I decided I would run away from programming and study some sort of social science like Max Weber did. My teacher, not knowing anything about social science, wanted me to stay, so he proposed that I just try to reimagine whatever social problems I was interested in as programming problems. 

I don't want to admit he was right, so now I try to do the opposite -- reimagine programming problems as social problems.

How do temporal inequalities translate resource disparities into unequal agency in making life-and-death decisions in cancer clinics?

How do spatial inequalities shape neighborhood vulnerability to and resilience against crises?

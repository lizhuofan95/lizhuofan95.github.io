<!-- When I started high school, I decided I would run away from programming and study some sort of social science like Max Weber did. My teacher, not knowing anything about social science, wanted me to stay, so he proposed that I just try to reimagine whatever social problems I was interested in as programming problems. 

I don't want to admit he was right, so now I try to do the opposite -- reimagine programming problems as social problems.

<h3 id="digital-capitalism">Digital Capitalism</h3>
<p>(or the economic sociology behind the AI hype)</p>
<p><strong>How</strong> does the market construct facial recognition technology as a legitimate commodity?</p>
<p><strong>How</strong> does open science consolidate rather than undermine corporate power over artificial intelligence (and all the hype about it)?</p>
<p><strong>How</strong> does digital capitalism revise Weber&rsquo;s thesis of rationalization and Foucault&rsquo;s idea of governmentality?</p>
<br />
<h3 id="computational-social-science">Computational Social Science</h3>
<p>(or the shoe leather and linear algebra behind the AI hype)</p>
<p><strong>How</strong> can we leverage large language models not to substitute, but to advance ethnographic methods?</p>
<p><strong>How</strong> can we study text as networks?</p>
<br />
<h3 id="temporal-and-spatial-inequality">Temporal and Spatial Inequality</h3>
<p>(or what we really live through when we live through inequality)</p>
<p><strong>How</strong> do temporal inequalities translate resource disparities into unequal agency in making life-and-death decisions in cancer clinics?</p>
<p><strong>How</strong> do spatial inequalities shape neighborhood vulnerability to and resilience against crises?</p>
